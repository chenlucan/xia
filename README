my first supposed-to-be complete project

ImageProcessing
1. gm - nodejs GraphicsMagicks, it depends on GraphicsMagicks/ImageMagicks
2. lwip - lightweight image processing
  - does not reply on third party modules

exif
1. node-exif for image only
2. file metadata

css is sufficient to display image thumbnails
