my first supposed-to-be complete project

ImageProcessing
1. gm - nodejs GraphicsMagicks, it depends on GraphicsMagicks/ImageMagicks
2. lwip - lightweight image processing
  - does not reply on third party modules

exif
1. node-exif for image only
2. file metadata

css is sufficient to display image thumbnails


I don't even need image processing library

gives very comprehensive list of css
css is going to be the new ui king

in fact all i need is discover all files (image, etc)
file - birth_time, hash
 images - exif
 movie  -
 docs   -

No thumbnail is needed in database
