my first supposed-to-be complete project

ImageProcessing
1. gm - nodejs GraphicsMagicks, it depends on GraphicsMagicks/ImageMagicks
2. lwip - lightweight image processing
  - does not reply on third party modules

exif
1. node-exif for image only
2. file metadata

css is sufficient to display image thumbnails

photo discover app by nwjs https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-photo-discovery-app-with-nw-js-part-1

js db
loki - http://lokijs.org/#/ - NoSQL
leveldb/level.js
indexeddb - NoSQL

Todo:
 - db not exist, file exit in pantry home
 - avoid importing pantry home into itself
 - [fixed] new imported not shown on timeline correct place
 - new imported photos only shows one in timeline
 - file modification time is changed -  - asked questions on Stackoverflow
 - seems duplicate import will not duplicate files, why is that?
